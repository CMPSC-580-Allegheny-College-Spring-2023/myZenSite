What is your interviewee's project?

    Her project was to develop an AI program that would be able to detect how much food would be needed for a restraunt or food service company. This will allow it to help with the prevention of food waste.  

Describe the prototype from your partner.

    Data collection and statistics. She went online and searched for a food database and she did a calculation for what food has best sold in a restraunt and what the revenue is for each restraunt. 

Describe the experiments from your partner.

    For the experiment she made a calculation which was able to tell how much revenue was produced by the restaraunt as well as how much food was used.

Describe how the experiments help the goals of the project and how they answer the research questions?

    Her experiment was for data collection. Her project is in 2 parts, the first is data collection , the second is making a model. This was the first part, and it helped her to determine how this would work for her project as well as how to detect errors in the data and account for them.

What are the limitations of the experimental work?

    Some of the limitations she faced were that she was not able to complete the second part of the project. She also found that some of the data had issues because she wasn't able to figure out the revenue/ Wen it printed the revenue was the same for each day, so she needs to figure out how to work with larger sets of data so that it can be more accurate.
    
What more could be done to improve the experimental work?

    She would need to find a larger data set and learn more about AI in order to be able to build the model part of her project.
